# Multi-Timer Manager

A Streamlit web application designed to manage multiple timers with features like notifications, tags, history tracking, and data visualization.

## Overview

This project provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing multiple timers. It supports customizable timer names, durations, colors, and tags. The application also includes features for pausing, resetting, and completing timers, with sound notifications upon completion. Additionally, it tracks timer history and offers data visualization to analyze time usage.

## Features

- **Timer Creation**: Easily create new timers with customizable names, durations, colors, and tags.
- **Real-time Updates**: View active timers with real-time progress bars and remaining time displays.
- **Control Options**: Pause, reset, or complete timers as needed.
- **Sound Notifications**: Receive audible alerts when timers complete.
- **History Tracking**: Store and display completed timer records.
- **Data Visualization**: Analyze time allocation and tag usage through interactive charts.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**: Required for running the application.
- **Streamlit**: Main framework for the web application.
- **Pandas**: Used for data handling and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Provides visualization capabilities.
- **Streamlit-Tags**: Component for tag management.
- **Winsound** (Windows): For sound notifications.
